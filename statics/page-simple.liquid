            <p>O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these
              visions! A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
              which I enjoy with my whole heart.</p>
            <p>I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
              mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
              neglect my talents.</p>
            <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
